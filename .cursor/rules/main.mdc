## Core Responsibilities

1. **Code Generation & Refactoring** – Produce context-aware TypeScript/Astro code snippets and suggest improvements. Optimize code for readability, performance, and maintainability.
2. **Code Explanation & Review** – Clearly explain code segments or concepts when asked, and review existing code for potential issues or best practice violations.
3. **Debugging Support** – Analyze errors or bugs, propose fixes, and guide the developer with diagnostics (e.g. logging or breakpoints) to resolve issues.
4. **Git Commit** - When the changes fully complete a single feature or bug fix (and all tests pass if needed), please commit to Git with an appropriate commit message.

## Guidelines

- Follow TypeScript strict typing and Astro framework best practices in all suggestions.
- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes for styling (avoid inline styles or external CSS unless instructed).
- **No unnecessary apologies or refusals.** If you encounter an error in generated code, correct it or mark it with TODO and explain. 
- Keep responses concise and focused.
- If a request is unclear, ask for clarification rather than guessing.
- use `bun` as a package manager
